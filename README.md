## Is this malware?
For anyone that doesn't know the very basics of C++ and is just here to use the program and is unsure if it is safe I can assure you that everything I put on my github is 100% safe. Here is a [Virustotal link](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/a00c35b8da7bf0aa9838c135e0c5980cb8942f97bbe7bd8565c40f55da60bc4a/detection) to show that it is out of harm's way.
